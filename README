Sample project to demonstrate using msbuild and psake to manage asp.net mvc application lifecycles. 

A fuller explanation of the cycles and msbuild are here:

http://blog.goneopen.com/2010/01/introduction-to-using-msbuild-to-manage-asp-net-mvc-application-lifecycles/

Currently, psake is implemented as a wrapper around msbuild to demonstrate the usage of psake (rather than how to write in poweshell)

Installation:

- ensure binaries from tools/ are installed

Usage:

- Run here.cmd

> invoke-psake package
> invoke-psake package -properties @{revision=1}


> msbuild /t:package
> msbuild /t:package /p:revision=1
